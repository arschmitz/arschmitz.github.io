I work with and contribute and maintain too many open source projects, in many different areas, I enjoy writing tools for testing and have worked with many testing related projects like QUnit, Intern, Perf Jankie, and aXe and have created tools like spider.js, to help with testing everything from basic unit tests to advanced rendering tests and live site spider. I have written many grunt plugins and node modules for everything from css pre-processing to games. You get the idea…"

Not so long ago this used to be a pretty simple thing to deal with. You had two basic type of input. There were mouse events, and keyboard events, and the two played very nicely together.",
					"These is not the case anymore and has not been for some time now. New input methods are being thought up every day. The biggest change that occurred to change all this was the introduction of touch events in iPhone OS  2 when everything got turned on its head. Now we have not only multiple implementations of the same events but competing standards for how events. Leading to browser fragmentation and the need for multiple code paths to handle the same thing. ",
