				"I started making websites very very early on. My mother was a graphic artist and my step father was a network administrator. I learned very young to do graphics arts from my mom. She worked in the packaging industry and worked from home. Because of this i had access to the full suites of professional graphics tools like freehand, illustrator, and photoshop. My earliest ventures into graphics were designing stickers and t-shirts for friends.",
				"We got the internet as soon as there was service available in the rural area in which we lived. I remember the first time i used the internet it was purely text based in a DOS like prompt on the 386 my step father had just built. It was not long before i was buying books and teaching myself how to write HTML. Meanwhile I had also started to teach myself QBasic with a friend of mine.",
				"Websites at this time lacked a lot though in the way of interactivity and the wow factor a ~10 year old wanted. I remember all this changing when the first version of flash came out. IT meant I could do all the cool interactive things I had previously only dreamed about. I immediately dove headfirst into making web pages and animations with the awesome new software. It was not long after this i made my first webpage for money. It was a website for a my art teacher. I remember spending night after night trying to get everything just right.",
				"I continued making webpages for school assignments random people who happened to ask, and for myself just for fun for many years. In highschool I learned C++ and wrote it for the remainder of my time in highschool. I decided to go to college for physics, with minors in chemistry and math. At this point  Web Development, and or programming as a career never even really crossed my mind. To me these were things i did for fun or to get something done but not a career something i could see myself doing everyday long term.",
				"It was still a pastime…",
				"To pay my way through college i became a chef and a baker. After college with no real job prospects I continued on this path while working part time with a small graphics house doing commercial graphics ( a LOT of bread bags ). I did all the web development here but it was just small boring static sites and didn’t really interest me. It was still really just something to do and earn some extra money though. After my restaurant closed i tried to go full time with the graphics and web dev but it didn’t last long before the economy turned and the company could no longer afford my services.",
				"At this point i took a job as a shuttle and parts dispatcher with a local chain of car dealerships just to get by. When i started here it was a pen and paper job. The only thing that was ever done to keep track was a photocopied piece of graph paper. With a whole lot of time on my hands i decided to improve processes and made a spreadsheet with lots of macros and built in features to track and keep records of all deliveries and drivers. I also sat near the body shop which did vinyl car graphics and signs. To help pass the time i started to work helping designing the graphics. It was not long before all of this work got the attention of the GM of the company. After only 3 months on the job i received a message from the GM that he wanted to talk to me. He was not happy with the company's websites and wanted someone to lead the company's internet strategy and based on my work so far and previous experience he wanted to know if i would be interested in the position. ",
				"When i started this new position it was just to maintain existing sites through a series of builders. However as i talked to the GM and other managers it became clear their needs were much more substantial. For the first time i needed to build real products and real customer facing websites that actually required more than just basic HTML and CSS they needed CMS, inventory management, sales integration and much more. As i began to work on and deploy these new products i was always looking for the next thing to improve and work on. As i worked i learned to love the technologies i was using unlike C++ which constituted the bulk of my real programming experience, PHP was an absolutely joy to program in. I loved how i could quickly and easily make actual useful websites.  As interactivity became more important i even learned to embrace JavaScript which i had disdained and avoided when possible for so many years. It was at this point which i realized i had finally found my true calling and what i loved and wanted to do as my paid occupation. It just happened i had been doing it all along.",

After the conference was over I was back at my hotel enjoying the hot tub after swimming some laps, when a couple asked if i minded if they joined me. I said no and they began some small talk about how the husband was there for a banking seminar of some sort, and how she was an accountant and was just along for the trip. I told them about how i was a developer that worked mostly on mobile and i was there for an accessibility conference. This immediately peaked her interest.",
				"She began to tell me how she started losing  her sight in her 20's. She told me how she still had some vision, so she could walk around and get by fine. She then described her difficulties seeing computer screens, and how she has had needed to learn to use a screen screen reader and rely on the keyboard. She also told me how she was stuck using an old cell phone with physical buttons and no features, because of her sight she needed to be able to memorize the buttons. She then asked me about if i knew any good options for her.",
				"I started to tell her about the iPhone and how it had a built in screen reader, Voiceover, and how part of my job and why i was there, was to work with experts, on ways to make websites especially mobile ones more accessible. She said she was familiar with voiceover for mac but had no idea they had anything like that for phones. In Fact her husband already had an iPhone with them.She got out of the pool dried off and ran upstairs to get their phone asking if i could meet them back in the lobby to show her how to use voiceover on the iPhone. I spent about 30 minutes with her showing her the basics of voice over on the iPhone.",
				"I will forever remember the look on her face when she used her husband's iPhone for the first time and realized she could have and use a smartphone too. After this she told me how she could not wait to get home and buy a new phone, and asked if she could have my email address if she had an questions in the future.",
				"That was 4 years ago, I only ever received one email from her a week later thanking me again for showing her how to use the iPhone and telling me she had already bought her own and could never thank me enough."
