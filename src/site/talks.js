However those familiar with typical desktop patterns may find themselves banging their heads against the wall when something \"simple\" doesn't work as expected. This session will go through some of the most common problems and pitfalls facing those jumping into jQuery Mobile. Areas covered will include injecting and enhancing dynamic content, working with enhanced form elements, refactoring for pageinit vs $(document).ready(), and the navigation model / page events."

I’ll go into our current road map and details (as many as are available right now) about the future of jQuery Mobile and what it will look like after 2.0",

What is the future of the two libraries? Which one is going away? Are either going away? These and many others are the type of questions I have been receiving from many people in the community since we started talking about merging the projects in the spring of 2013. I will address these questions and many more, will give you some history behind the changes we are making as well as give some insight into the direction the projects are taking, and how we’re going to make integration with both projects easier for developers.",
