		early: "I started using the internet and programming at a very young age due to having parents in the graphics design and tech inductries" +
			" early on i start using technologies as they emmegred ( may sound bad now but when flash came out it to me it was the best thing EVER!!! ) " +
			" My early programming experience in programming was making games in basic for my friends and i. And later embedding backdoors in them to play pranks" +
			" ( lets not tell to many people about that one ), and programming robotics in middle school.",
		learning: "My first real programming experience came in highschool when i learned C++ taking computer science 1 and teaching my self 2." +
			"I tested out of both classes for college credit as a sophmore and was the youngest stundent to complete computer sciense 1 and only to complete 2 when i did so" +
			" as a sophmore. In college i dove into c++ for the next 4 years while attending for physics / math / and chemistry" +
			" as part of my physics major i concentrated on computer modeling",
		afterCollege: " After college i ended up working as a chef / baker for a few years and opening a restaurant, while also working as a " + 
			" graphic designer, and web developer. After things went bad with the restaurant i began working for a chain of car dealerships, " +
			" I ran their web department, tasked with bringing their websites into the modern age and driving the overall internet strategy",
		OSS: "Durring my time working with car dealerships was when i really became passionate about open source and accessability. We used all " +
			"free and opensource projects on our sites, and as our needs expanded into the mobile sector. I began using and contributing to jQuery Mobile" +
			"after a short while i joined the team for a summit in Washington DC and was asked to join.",
		rollerCoaster: "After joining the team things were a rollacoaster ride! 2 Weeks later i was on a plan to South Korea to speak at the next jQuery" +
			"conference. 3 Months after that i started contracting with the jQuery Foundation parth time and 3 months after that i became the Development " +
			"Lead for the jQuery, 2 months later i started working full time with the jQuery Foundation and dedicating all of my developments to OSS",
		accessability: "I became passionate about accessability early on, believeing that everyone deserves equal access to the internet and the wonderful" +
			"things, and wealth of information which it has to offer. However for me there was a turning point where it went from something i was concious of" +
			" to something i preached about. I was in washington D.C. for a summit on mobile accessability representing the jQuery Foundation. After the conference was over " +
			" i was back at my hotel enjoying the hottub after swimming some laps, when a couple asked if i minded if they joined me. I said no and they began some small talk about" +
			" how the husband was there for a banking seminar of some sort, and how she  She was an accountant and was just along for the trip. I told them about how i was a " +
			" developer that worked mostly on mobile and i was there for an accessability conference. This immeditly peaker her interest. She began to tell me how she started losing" +
			" her sight in her 20's. She told me how she still had some vision, so she could walk around and get by fine. She then described though her diffacutlies seeing computer" +
			" screens and how she has had need to learn to use a screen screen reader and rely on the keyboard. She also told me how she was stuck using an old cell phone with" +
			" physical buttons and no features, because of her sight she needed to be able to memorize the buttons. She then asked me about if i knew any good options for her. " +
			" I started to tell her about the iPhone and how it had a built in screen reader Voice Over and how part of my job and why i was there, was to work with experts. " +
			" on ways to make websites espically mobile ones more accessible. She said she was familiar with voice over for mac but had no idea they " +
			" had any thing like that for phones. Infact her husband already had an iPhone with them, she got out of the pool dried off and ran upstrairs to get their phone asking " +
			" if i could meet them back in the lobby to show her how to use voice over on the iPhone. I spent about 30 minutes with her showing her the basics of voice over on the" +
			" iPhone. I will forever remember the look on her face when she used her husbands iPhone for the first time and realized she could have use a smart phone too." +
			" After this she told me how she could not wait to get home and buy a new phone, and asked if she could have my email address if she had an questions in the future. " +
			" That was 4 years ago, i only ever recieved one email from her a week later thanking me again for showing her how to use the iphone and telling me she had already bought" +
			" her own and could never thank me enough. "
